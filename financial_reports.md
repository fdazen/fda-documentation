The Financial Reports include all those reports that have to do with daily transactions performed at your property, and they offer a precise understanding of all financial operations. For this reason, these will mostly important to your Accounting Department. These include:

##**Additional Revenue Breakdown**

This report includes information about posted POS items and Add-Ons. There are a variety of filters that will allow you to choose how you want the results to displayed. This report is useful for many reasons: it allows the Accounting department to follow up with  how many actual extra charges have been sold for a certain date range, and it allows them to include a folio breakdown where you can see where in the system the charges have been posted. As results can also be organized around the user who posted the item, it comes handy if your hotel needs to calculate commission based on upsell items. 

{{site.data.alerts.important}} Additional revenue is <span style="color:red;">independent</span> of room type and folio status, that is, there is currently no link in the reporting system between an add-on/POS item and Room Type or Folio Status. This means that all additional revenue will be included every time, regardless of the Room Types, Folio Status and Sources/Markets selected. {{site.data.alerts.end}}


- In the reports list, click on the link _Additional Revenue Breakdown_:

The _Trial Balance Report_ provides a summary of all financial transactions for a specific date, and compares it with information from the beginning of the fiscal year. It displays three important pieces of information: the _Opening Balance_, the _Transaction Net_ and the _Closing Balance_.
The Opening Balance is the sum of the Total Revenue plus all Taxes minus all Payments, from the beginning of the fiscal year up to the day prior to running the Trial Balance report.
You will need to choose a date on which to run the Trial Balance: for that selected date, the report will show a summary of all revenue broken down by charge type, all tax and also a summary of all payments recorded for that date, thus giving what we call a Transaction Net.  
The Transaction Net will then be summed up to the Opening Balance, thus giving what we call the Closing Balance, which is the resulting balance for the hotel for the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Remember that you will need to manually select the starting date of your Fiscal Year, by choosing the report filters!  
Note that the Opening Balance should always be identical to the previous date's Closing Balance.
