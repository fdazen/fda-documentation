Creating a multiple rooms reservation for small or large groups is easy in Frontdesk Anywhere: from only one panel you are able to streamline the reservation process, manage booking status, set up payment rules and print/send group messages.       
 ##**Step 1.** New Group      
  - Begin by clicking on the blue button _NEW GROUP_ on top of your Tape Chart:   
  ![]([favicon.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/favicon.jpg)        
  - A new window will pop up: insert the Group Name in the first field, and select the Source and Market from the available options in the second and last field. Once done, click on the blue button _NEXT_:

  ##**Step 2.** Choose the group’s stay date and the room information     
   - Using the two scroll down calendars, select the check-in and check-out dates of the group. If you need shoulder dates, or if part of the group is staying longer/shorter, you will be able to adjust details in the next step.

   - Choose the room type of your choice by selecting the right option from the respective scroll down menu: if your group has booked more room types, you will be given the option to add more rooms once _Step 2_ is completed:

When you choose a room type, the scroll down menus with the tags ‘Rates’ and ‘No. Rooms’ will automatically update to give you only those rates/rooms that are available for that specific room type.   
- If you wish to customize the rate for the group, you can easily do this by clicking on the blue link **Edit Rate** next to the ‘Rate’ scroll down menu. You will have two options: you can either edit the daily price, by clicking on the circle box _Daily Price Edit_:

Or you can click on the circle box Fixed Price Edit, to change the total for each room:

   Click on the yellow button **Update** to save your changes and go back to the **Group Reservation**.   
   - Choose how you want to assign rooms for this group. You will have three options:    
        ![](image)   
        
   
**Auto Assign** will make the system automatically assign the rooms among the ones available.   
**Unassign** will create the group without any room assignment.   
**Manual Assign** will enable you to choose the rooms among the ones available.    

Select your option and click on the blue button _ADD ROOMS_. 

##**Step 3.** Manual Assignment (skip to Step 4 if not applicable)   

- If you chose the Manual Assignment option, the following panel will pop-up:

Make your choice and click on the button _SELECT_ when done.   
Click on the blue button _ADD ROOMS_.   

##**Step 4.** Select Group Reservation Status   

- Once the rooms are added, there will appear a brief summary and you will need to choose the group reservation status:   
     ![](image)   
     

Choose:   

   **Reserve** if you want to finalize the reservation as reserved   
   **Hold** if you want to hold rooms for the group without fully reserving them      
   **Block / DNR** if you want to take the rooms out of your current inventory   

- If you choose to hold rooms, you will be given two options:   
     ![](image)   
     
If you select a Manual Release for the rooms, the rooms will stay as Holds until you manually change the status in the Group Folio.   

If you select Automatic Release, you will need to choose a certain date from the scroll down calendar: the system will automatically release the rooms on that date if the latter have not been reserved up to then.   

##**Step 5.**  Removing a room from the Room Queue   

- If you made a mistake and reserved too many rooms, you can remove the extra ones by clicking on the button ‘Remove’:

- Select the number of rooms you wish to remove and click on the blue button _SAVE_.   

When ready, you can click on the button _NEXT_ to go to the next step.   

**NOTE**: If you wish to add more room types to the reservation, you will need to go repeat all steps from **Step 2**   


##**Step 6.** Group Rules   

You will be now looking at your Group Reservation.

- Under the column ‘Balance’ you will notice that the first reservation in the list has, by default, all of  the group’s charges. If you want to change this and set up a different payment arrangement, click on _GROUP RULES_ on the top of the panel
