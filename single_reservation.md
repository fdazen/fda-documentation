#**Single Reservation**  

You can create solo reservations easily with a simple click on the Tape Chart. You will need to make sure that the room you are trying to book for the chosen dates is available for the date range the reservation is for. 


1. ##**Choosing Dates and Showing Availability**  


The first way you can start creating a single reservation is by clicking directly on the empty box on your Tape Chart, corresponding to the day and room you want to book. 


 - Start by going to the _Frontdesk_ tab, upon login:  


 ![Solo_res_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_1.png)  
 
 
 - If the day you want to make the reservation for is not displaying on the Tape Chart, make sure to update the calendar accordingly, so that you will be able to visualize all availability for the requested date range:

Note that you can also use the View tabs on the top of your Tape Chart to make sure you have a good understanding of what is and is not available for the selected date range:  


![Solo_res_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_3.png)  


- Use the arrows on the top left corner of your Tape Chart, to see expand the Tape Chart and see what room is available for the selected period:  


![Solo_res_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_4.png)  


- Select the box corresponding to the room you want to book and the guest's arrival date; another window will pop-up:    

![Solo_res_5.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_5.png)  


That window is called **Reservation Folio**. 


2. ##**Entering Booking Information**  


###**RESERVATION INFORMATION**  
  
- In each folio, the reservation details are organized into three different columns. The first column, called _Duration_ bears general information about the reservation:  

![Solo_res_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_6.png)   


- There are two scroll down calendars where you can edit the reservation duration. In the example below, my guest is booking from 02/11 through 02/15:  

![Solo_res_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_7.png)  

- The dates of your choice will be shown underneath the calendar, along with the room number the reservation has been assigned to, and the corresponding room type:  

![Solo_res_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_8.png)  

- You can select the number of people and children associated with this booking, by using the scroll down menus next to the tags _Adults_ and _Children_:  

![Solo_res_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_9.png)
  
Note that the values appearing in these menus have been configured by the account administrator at your hotel, and the system won't allow you to set up a higher occupancy than the one that has been configured.  
  
- You can proceed to fill in all the information under the _Duration_ column. Note that most fields are entirely customizable, so you will probably see a different set of information than the one appearing in the picture below:  

![Solo_res_10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_10.png)  

- The **OTA#** field is where you can record the confirmation number from Online Travel Agencies associated with the booking you are entering in your account. Note that in case your account is integrated with any of these sites, this field will be automatically fill in upon receipt of the reservation:  

![Solo_res_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_11.png)  

Note that once the _OTA#_ field has been filled in, that value will also be appearing on the top left hand side of the reservation folio:  

![Solo_res_13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_13.png)

  
###**GUEST INFORMATION**  


The middle column of the reservation folio bears information about the guest/s:  

![Solo_res_12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_12.png)

 - The _Profile ID_ field will be automatically filled in once the name and last name of the guest has been filled in:  
 
 ![Solo_res_14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_14.png)


Note that once you start typing the guest name, the system will automatically prompt you with suggestions that match what you have typed in. In the example below, you can see that when when I type in the name _Test_, the system will prompt me with any information matching the combination of first and last name. Note also that each of those suggestion is numbered: that is the Profile ID number associated with each of those guests.  

![Solo_res_15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_15.png)

Selecting a prompted suggestion will make the Profile ID field default to the Profile ID number:  

![Solo_res_16.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_16.png)  

If you do not select any suggestion, a new unique Profile ID will be creating upon reserving the booking.  

- Under the _Guest Information_ column, at the bottom, you will find a place where to insert the guest's credit card number. Click on the small box with the three horizontal lines, next to the written _Credit Cards_ and then click on **Add Card**:  

![Solo_res_17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_17.png)  


- A new panel will pop down with all the relevant fields you will need to record credit card details. Insert all information and click on the button _Save Card_:  

![Solo_res_18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_18.png)
  
  
- If the guest's billing address is different from the guest's address, uncheck the box next to the tag _Billing Information_: new fields will appear below and you will be able to record a different billing address:  

![Solo_res_19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_19.png)  

**Note**: credit card information entered into the reservation folio **will not** be saved under the Guest Profile. This means that unless you have saved the card directly in the guest's _profile_, under the _Prifile Tab_, the credit card information is not going to be saved. If you need instructions on how to record credit card information into Guest Profiles, please go to the **Profile** section of this manual!  


###**RATE INFORMATION**  

The right column of the reservation folio bears information about rates, taxes and additional charges.  

![Solo_res_20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_20.png)
  
  
 - The scroll down menu will contain information about all available rates the account administrator has set up for the selected date, for the selected room type. In the example below, we have two rates applied to this room type, for the chosen date:  

![Solo_res_21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Solo_res_21.png)
  ,j
The _Offered Rate_ is the one that the administrator has set up as _default_ for the room type for the selected date range. If there are other availble rates for the date and room type specified, you will be able to see them in the drop down menu, under _Available Rates_.
