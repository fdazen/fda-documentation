summary: A description of the financial reports in FDA.

##**Lodging Statistics Report (LSR)**

- Get a day-by-day breakdown of your lodging information and revenue over a period of your choosing. You can look at historical data and forecast future information too. Can filter on source, market and room type.

- Multiple Properties are aggregated (ie compiled together) and not shown sequentially.



 
##**Manager's Report (MR)**
 
- Intended as a quick report for a manager to look at. It shows daily, month-to-date and year-to-date information for the property's lodging statistics, revenue and settlements made. It also includes forecasting information up to 1 year in the future.


##**Pace Report (PAC)**

- Likely to be renamed something like “Business Pick Up Report”

- The Reservation Booking Pace captures how many individual and business block reservations were on the books on any specific day, and tracks booking trends to maximize revenues.

- Basically, put in a date range you want to see occupancy %/revenue/adr for and then compare those values between 2 dates. i.e. I want to see what my OTB numbers and revenue for November 01 - 30 were on October 20th and then again on October 25th so I can see how many bookings I've picked up/lost in those 5 days.

- This report is on the PostgreSQL DB so accounts will not be added by default. Request "Advanced Reports" if access is necessary (will take some time to sync across)
