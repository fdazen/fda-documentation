## The Payment Panel  

 - The payment section is located on the right column of the folio, right under the summary of all charges, and it is accessible by clicking on the blue _Payment_ link:  

![payments_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_1.png)  


 - Clicking on the link will bring up a pop up panel from where you can perform all operations related to payments:  
 
 
![pay1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay1.png)

 
   
   
The Payment panel can be separated into two main sections:     
 

 - The **Payments** drop down menu lists all payment details and operations recorded for the folio. It also brings information about what payments have been applied to certain charges, and what not: indeed, the **U/A** tag means **Unapplied** (Payments) and reminds to the amount of payments that have not or not yet been applied to charges.  


![payments_4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_4.png)




 - The **Payment Type** section is where you actually submit the payments:

## Recording a Payment


### Recording a Payment Without Applying it to a Charge   
  
  

 - To record a payment, first select the _Payment Type_ by choosing the appropriate choice from the ones available in the drop down menu:    
  
  
![payments_6.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_6.png)


- Place the amount the guest is paying in the box on the left:   


![payments_7.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_7.png)




- If applicable, write down the receipt number in the _Receipt Number_ box and a description in the box with the tag _Description_:  


![payments_8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_8.png)



- To record the transaction, click on the green button _Pay Now_:  


![payments_9.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_9.png)




- You will see the message _Payment Successful_ once the action has been finalized:  



![payments_10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_10.png)


- You will be able to see the payment details by clicking on the _Payments_ drop down menu. From this panel you can see the type of operation performed, the type of payment used and the date and time when the operation was successfully recorded in the system:  


![payments_10_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_10_1.png)



Note that if the recorded payment has not been or not yet been applied to a specific charge, the amount the guest paid will also appear under column _Unapplied Payment_:  


![payments_11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_11.png)





  
  
## Invoices  

Each folio has a dedicated section called _Invoices_ : this is the place where you can isolate existent folio charges into different invoices. This feature is used when having to split bills for your guests, along with printing the associated receipts.  

If you do need to isolate any of the charges and associated payments, just follow these simple instructions!  

**BEFORE STARTING**:  Invoices have some unique statuses that are key to understand as they impact what actions can be done to them.  


1. **Draft**: A newly created Invoice will appear in Draft status until it is issued. Draft invoices can be Deleted, Issued or have Transfers Reversed.  
2. **Delete**: Remove all references to a draft invoice. 
3. **Issued**: Confirm a draft invoice and generate a unique number.  
4. **Cancel**: Voids an issued invoice. The invoice name and number will remain for record keeping purposes.  





### Create a New Invoice  

In order to transfer charges/applied payments, you will first need to create a new invoice.  

- In the folio, click on the link _Invoice_:


![pay2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay2.png)

  
- A pop-up panel will come up.  You will see a transaction drop down menu which, if expanded, will list all charges contained in the folio. You will also see a transfer transactions button which enable you to move any of those listed charges:
    


![pay3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay3.png)


- The first step to split charges into an invoice is to actually create the invoice. You can only transfer charges, if there is an invoice where to transfer charges to. 
To create a new invoice, click on the button **Transfer Transactions**:
  
  
  
 ![pay4.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay4.png)
 
  
  
- Expand section _Transfer to Invoice_ by clicking on the three dots on the right hand side and then click on the button **Create Invoice**:

![pay8.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay8.png)




- After clicking on the button create invoice, a new invoice will drop down menu will appear on the screen. If you want to rename the invoice, click on the red written _New Invoice_ to make the field editable and type in a new name:
  


![pay54.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay54.png)


- Select the charges to transfer to the newly created invoice by checking the boxes on any charges listed under menu transactions. To transfer those selected charges, click on the small arrow icon on section _Transfer to Invoice_:



![pay10.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay10.png)


- Transferred charges will appear under the _Newly Created Invoice_. Note that they also remain listed under _Transactions_, although with a $0 balance as they have now been placed under the invoice:


![pay11.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay11.png)


- The invoice will be in a **Draft** status until it is issued, meaning it is finalized or confirmed. You can change the status of the invoice by clicking on the three bars action button on the right hand side of the screen. **A draft invoice can be deleted, issued or have the transfer undone**:
  


![pay12.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay12.png)



  
- When an invoice is issued, it will be tagged with a unique number:

![pay13.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay13.png)  


- Note that once an invoice has been issued, it can only be cancelled. When this happens, all charges that were originally transferred to the invoice will be re-listed under section transfers:

![pay14.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay14.png)


### Applying Payments to Charges    

When you split charges into different invoices, you will need to reflect payments in the folio that are relative to those charges, so that the invoice will show a balance of $0.

We call this feature **Apply Payments**: it is the ability to associated payments to certain charges. 
**Note**: payments can only be applied to those charges that are listed under an _Issued_ invoice.  


- To apply payments to charges, click on the link _Payments_ on the right hand side of the folio:

![pay15.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay15.png)
  
  
- Expand the payments list and expand the payment details relative to the credit that needs to be applied to the invoice. At the bottom you will see a _Transactions_ drop down menu which will show you all invoices created on the folio with all the relative listed charges:  

![pay17.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay17.png)  


- Select those charges you want to have linked to the payments and type in the amount you want to apply. In the example below I am applying the full $50 payment to one $110 charge.
When done, click on the yellow button **Apply to Payments**:

![pay18.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay18.png)


- A _Successful_ message will appear at the top in green. A summary of applied charges will also appear at the bottom of the payments list:

![pay20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay20.png)
  
  
  
- If you now open the _Invoice_ blue link back in the folio, you will notice that the balance of the invoice will go down by the amount of the applied payments.

![pay21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay21.png)

  



  




  
### Printing an Invoice  

Each invoice has its own balance, corresponding to the charges it contains and the payment that have been applied to those charges. From time to time you might need to separate the bills and print receipts that will only show certain charges/payments.  

- To print a receipt, simply click on the three horizontal bars, next to the right invoice:    


![pay23.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/pay23.png)


- Click on the option _Invoice_ to bring up the printable receipt:  


![payments_36.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_36.png)

![payments_39.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_39.png)



**Convert to Deposit** will change the payment from being recorded as a payment proper into a Security Deposit.  
**Void** will annul the payment.  
**Refund** will enable you to refund part or the whole of the payment. If you wish to partially refund your guests, fill in the box with the amount you wish to refund and click on the box _Refund_.

  
  
### Recording a Security Deposit  


- You can record security deposits directly from the same Payment screen. Choose the Pay Type and insert the amount you want to have recorded as a deposit:  


![payments_40.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_40.png)



- Check the box with the tag _Take as Deposit_ and click on the button _Pay Now_:  


![payments_41.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_41.png)




- If you open the _Payments_ drop down menu, you will see that the sum is recorded in the system as a _Deposit_, and not under _Amount_:  



![payments_42.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_42.png)

  


- In the folio screen, the amount submitted as deposit will appear in the field _Security Deposits_:  


![payments_43.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_43.png)


  
  
###Turning a Security Deposit into a Payment  


- It might often happen that your guests will want to turn their security deposits into payments to set their bills. This is easily done: expand the _Payment_ tab to individuate the deposit:    


![payments_44.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_44.png)

 ![payments_46.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_46.png)



## Capturing Credit Card Details With Credit Card Swiper  
    
      
      
      
Your Frontdesk Anywhere account can be integrated with any _Credit Card Swiper_ that uses **Keyboard Emulation** tool. A credit card Swiper will enable you to capture your guests' credit card numbers and expiration date in an automatic fashion, thus making the reservation process much quicker and reducing the possiblity of human error.  




- To start using the credit card Swiper, click on the folio you want to record the card details:  


![profiles_35.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_35.png)



- Scroll down to the Credit Card panel at the center of the folio, and clik on the link _Add Card_:  


![profiles_36.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_36.png)  


- You will see the button _Swipe Credit Card_: click on it:  


![profiles_37.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_37.png)  


- Once you click the button, the written _Swipe Card_ will start flashing: swipe the credit card using the card Swiper:  


![profiles_38.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_38.png)  


- You should hear a beeping sound when the card details get captured, and you will be able to see those details in the relevant fields:  


![profiles_39.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_39.png)



- You will be able to find the _Swipe Card_ function that enables you to capture the card details in the _Payment Screen_:   


![profiles_40.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_40.png)


You can use the Swiper in the _Profile_ tab, in the relevant Payment section:  


![profiles_41.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/profiles_41.png)  




## Processing Payments with Payment Processing 


If your account is integrated with a Payment Gateway, you will be able to _process_ payments for credit cards directly into the Payment screen.  


- To process a payment, select **Credit card** from the Payment Type drop down menu:  



![payments_47.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_47.png)



- Enter the credit card type from the _Card Type_ drop down menu. Note that if the guest has a credit card loaded in the folio, there will be an option to select that card:  


![payments_48.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_48.png)  



In the case you select the existent card, all relevant fields will be automatically filled in; otherwise, you can select the card type and insert the card number and the expiration dates.    



- Place the amount you want to charge the guest:  


![payments_49.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_49.png)



- When Payment Gateway is active you will have the option to either charge the card, or authorize it:  


![payments_50.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_50.png)



**Authorizing** the card will place a hold on the guest's card for the amount you selected.  
**Pay Now** will automatically charge the guest's card for the selected amount.  



- If you choose to authorize the card, you will receive a _Payment Successful_ message on the screen. You can open the _Payments_ drop down menu to look up the authorization: the latter will appear in a blue color:  


![payments_51.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/payments_51.png)



The amount corresponding to the authorization appears in light grey, and the overall balance is not affected by it.  


- If you click on the _Authorization_ blue button, you will be able to access the details and see the available actions that you can perform:  



- If you want to capture the amount, or part of the authorized amount, insert the relevant value in the box and click on the blue button _Capture_:  





 When connected to a Payment Gateway, you will still able to convert payments to deposit, void them or refund them. However, the refund option is only available for charges that have already been processed by the merchant account; if you have only just processed a payment and you want to refund it, you can void it and re-place the charge. Charges voided within the day of charge won't be processed by the merchant account.{{site.data.alerts.end}}



## Transferring Charges      

You have the ability to transfer all or part of a folio charges either to another folio or to a Profile.

Before you follow the instructions below, make sure that the Profile you want to send charges to **has at least one invoice created**; if it does not, you will need to create one. You can follow instructions [here](http://docs.frontdeskanywhere.net.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build/profiles.html).To do so, follow the instructions on the _Profile_ section of this manual. It is also recommendable having the Profile ID number handy, in order to avoid confusion in case there are multiple profiles with the same name.

- If you now go back to the profile you will see transferred charges listed under the selected invoice:  

![inc111.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/inc111.png)

  
  
### Applying Payments to Charges   


When you transfer charges to different invoices, you will need to reflect payments that are relative to those charges, so that the invoice will show a balance of $0.
