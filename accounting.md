## Accounting



The Accounting section is the place here you configure all those settings that have to do with payments, currencies, credit cards, fiscal year, etc. Most importantly it is home to Revenue Management: you can build Revenue Labels and Categories around which your reports are organized.  

## **Currency**  

During the intial system set-up it is important for you to configure the right currency, as this will be displayed in all guest communications and if applicable, on IBE.  

- Click on the blue link **Currency** under section _Accounting_:


![accounting1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/accounting1.png)



 

- Select the right currency among the ones available in the scroll down menu:  

![Accounting_2.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Accounting_2.png)


{{site.data.alerts.note}} If your currency is not listed in the drop down menu, please contact our Support Team at help@frontdeskanywhere.com and ask them to have the currency added to your account!  {{site.data.alerts.end}}


 - Choose whether to enable security deposits on your reservation folios by clicking on the relevant circle box.

![Accounting_3.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Accounting_3.png)



Activating the security deposit will enable you to record payments as deposits rather than payments proper. When deposits are enabled, there will be track of them in each reservation folio:

##**Fiscal Year**  

Each property has a different starting date for their Fiscal Year, depending on applicable governmental laws: for this reason we advise you to set this up during the intial configuration of your account.  

- Click on the blue link **Fiscal Year** under section _Accounting_:

 - In the Admin Settings, click on the blue link **Pay Types** under section _Accounting_:  
 

![accounting_5_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/accounting_5_1.png)

##**Payment Processing**  

Your PMS can integrate with many secure payment gateways that will make charging a guest's card much faster and your check-in process much easier! 


- In the Admin Settings, click on the link **Payment Processing** under section _Accounting_:  


![accounting_16_1.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/accounting_16_1.png)

![Accounting_19.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Accounting_19.png)


{{site.data.alerts.note}} the username and password might not be called 'username' and 'password'. Each gateway has its own name for API credentials. We advise you to speak to your gateway;s representative if you are unable to find this information. If you have any questions or issues during the set up of Payment Processing, send an email to help@frontdeskanywhere.com  {{site.data.alerts.end}}



- You will now be able to see the payment gateway:  


![Accounting_20.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Accounting_20.png)

 

- All is left to do is enable the gateway on both/either the Frontdesk area and/or your Booking Engine. Enabling the gateway on work area Frontdesk means guests' cards can be charged directly from the folio. Enabling the gateway on IBE means credit cards can be authenticated and processed when guests book online on your website:  

![Accounting_21.png]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Accounting_21.png)




Learn how to configure the way the system is to charge your guests' cards on IBE by reading chapter [IBE](http://docs.frontdeskanywhere.net.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build/IBE_general.html), section _Payment Collection Rules_.
